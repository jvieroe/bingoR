This snippet of code was put together in a hurry for a round of online Christmas bingo.

The first part sets up the game. It includes British nicknames for the numbers (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_bingo_nicknames).

The second part of the code (from 'PLAY CHRISTMAS BINGO') is the actual game and is run for each 'bingo draw'.

Enjoy!
